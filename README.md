# Avant
Nobody leaked anything, don't buy a version of any Avant console, trust me, you are being ripped off, and possibly being given malware.
There shouldn't be anybody taking credit or "in power" for leaking something that isn't theirs, stop trying to profit off of the work of others, it's disrespectful and despicable.

At this point, I don't really care anymore, the hate groups that are created in spite of me and the backlash to my loved ones is incredibly immature, and some of you individuals have really got to learn that there is more to life than Roblox. Some of the things that I've seen over the past few days is super immature, and very odd considering the amount of things that are stacked up against certain individuals.
There is a new version that's not open to the public and won't be, ever.
